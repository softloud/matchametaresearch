The matcha metaresearch seminar series is a joint collaboration of [The Norwegian Institute for Nature Research](https://www.nina.no/english/) (NINA) and the [Interdisciplnary Metaresearch Group](https://imerg.info/) at the University of Melbourne. 

The inspiration for this collaboration was the number of people in both groups who wished to hear from people in the other group.
