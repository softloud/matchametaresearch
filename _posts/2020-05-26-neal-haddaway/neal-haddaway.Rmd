His research focuses on developing evidence synthesis methodology to improve repeatability, transparency and accessibility of systematic reviews and systematic maps. He is the cofounder of the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon (www.eshackathon.org) and the Open Synthesis Working Group (http://opensynthesis.github.io). He is the co-leader of the Swedish Centre of the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, and the co-convener of the Climate Solutions Coordinating Group of the Campbell Collaboration.
