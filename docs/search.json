It’s useful to have a short one-sentence description of your talk.\nFor example: Neal Haddaway provided us with:\n\n#OpenSynthesis – how and why we should embrace and develop Open Science principles in evidence synthesis to maximise efficiency, rigour, transparency, legacy and impact of #SystematicReviews\n\nwhich has 190 characters, allowing us to @ the speaker, as well.\nIntended audience\nThink lab meeting.\nThis is a webinar series of interest to the Interdisciplinary Metaresearch Group and the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research. There will be certainly be ecologists, research software engineers, and philosophers of science in attendence.\nIn addition, the talks will be advertised to the general academic community, so people may join from any number disciplines with an interest in metaresearch.\nWe suggest tailoring the content for a general academic audience, rather than assuming in-depth discipline-specific knowledge. Instead we invite you to frame your content from the perspective that metascience is a comparative discipline, seeking to explore what we might learn from shared scientific methodologies and practices across disciplines.\nIt might be just Matt and Charles\nWe’re both introverts and don’t truck much with the whole social media branding and whatnot. Our motivation for creating this repository of talks was to share with those who might be interested, do a little bit towards due diligence towards the spirit of open science.\nWe don’t do a heap of advertising, and with the time zone differences, not everyone who is interested can attend in person. The videos are posted to the blog, and people do catch up after the event.\nWe invite people who would take an hour of their time to have a coffee with us, as colleagues with shared interests, and record these seminars for anyone else who might benefit.\nRecorded webinars\nWebinars will be recorded in Teams and uploaded to the NINA youtube channel. In addition, talk and abstract will be posted to this blog.\nSlides\nWe will post the slides to this blog.\nStructure of webinar\nShort introduction from organisers describing structure of webinar\n20-40 minute presentation from invited speaker\nOrganisers invite questions via chat\n10-20 minutes of question time, depending on length of talk\nLess than one hour total\nOpt out\nIf any of these elements concern you, please contact the organisers to opt out. For example, you may not wish to be recorded, or share your slides, for in progress research.\n\n\n",
