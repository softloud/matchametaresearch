Thank you for accepting an invitation to speak in the matcha metaresearch webinar series. Organisers will be in touch with reminders, and a request for bio, title, and abstract ahead of the talk.

## Intended audience

This is a webinar series of interest to the Interdisciplinary Metaresearch Group and the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research. There will be certainly be ecologists, research software engineers, and philosophers of science in attendence.

In addition, the talks will be advertised to the general academic community, so people may join from any number disciplines with an interest in metaresearch. 

We suggest tailoring the content for a general academic audience, rather than assuming in-depth discipline-specific knowledge. Instead we invite you to frame your content from the perspective that metascience is a comparative discipline, seeking to explore what we might learn from shared scientific methodologies and practices across disciplines. 

## Recorded webinars

Webinars will be recorded in Teams and uploaded to the NINA youtube channel. In addition, talk and abstract will be posted to this blog.
